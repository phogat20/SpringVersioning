# API versioning

API versioning is a way of managing changes to an API over time. As an API evolves, it's often necessary to make changes that are not backward compatible. 
This means that if client applications are built against an older version of the API, they may not work properly with the new version.

# There are several approaches to versioning an API, including:

1. URL-based versioning: 
   - This approach adds a version number to the API's URL. 
   - Each new version of the API would have a different URL.
   - Example: https://api.example.com/v1/users
   
2. Query parameter versioning: 
   - This approach adds a version number as a query parameter.
   - Example: https://api.example.com/users?version=1.

3. Header-based versioning: 
   - This approach adds a version number as a custom header.
   - Example: X-API-Version: 1.

4. Content negotiation versioning: 
   - This approach uses the Accept header to indicate the desired API version
   - Example: Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json.

# When to use each versioning strategy in a Spring Boot application:

1. URI path versioning: 
   - This strategy is useful when you want to include the version number as part of the resource URL. 
   - It's often used in RESTful APIs and can be useful when you want to have different versions of the same resource available at the same time.

2. Query parameter versioning: 
   - This strategy is useful when you want to provide backward compatibility for older clients while still allowing the API to evolve over time. 
   - It's often used when you want to add new functionality to an existing API without breaking existing clients.

3. Header versioning: 
   - This strategy is useful when you want to keep the URL consistent across different API versions. 
   - It's often used when you want to separate the versioning information from the resource URL and keep the URL clean and simple.

4. Content negotiation versioning: 
   - This strategy is useful when you want to negotiate the API version based on the request's Accept header.
   - It's often used when you want to provide a more fine-grained control over the versioning process and provide the client with the most appropriate response based        on the requested version.


# Several factors to consider when choosing a versioning strategy for your Spring Boot application, including:

   1. Compatibility: 
      - The versioning strategy should be compatible with your API design and how you want to expose your resources to clients. 
      - For example, if you have a RESTful API, URI path versioning may be a better fit.

   2. Complexity: 
      - Some versioning strategies may require more code and configuration than others. 
      - For example, header versioning may require additional code to extract the custom header from incoming requests.

   3. Client compatibility: 
      - If you have many clients consuming your API, you may need to consider how each client version will interact with the API.
      - Query parameter versioning can be a good choice if you want to provide backward compatibility for older clients while still allowing the API to evolve over             time.

   4. Maintainability:
      - The versioning strategy should be easy to maintain over time. 
      - If the chosen strategy results in complex and hard-to-understand code, it may become difficult to maintain over time.

   5. Performance: 
      - Some versioning strategies may impact performance due to increased request size or complexity. 
      - For example, query parameter versioning may result in longer URLs, which can negatively impact performance.

   6. Developer preferences: 
      - Some developers may prefer one versioning strategy over another based on their experience and expertise.
